Vi or Vim for Vi improved is a command line text editor like no other. It is pre-installed on all modern ubuntu machines and is considered an industry standard. Invented by the William Nelson Joy, this simple and lightweight text editor is at the forfront of inovation. Vim has its own scripting language which permits the end user to customize the editor to the users pleasing. From keybinding to project tree plugins, vim's limits are space... but thats for another time(spacevim)!!! After trying emacs, moving over to vim was a pleasure. The shortcuts make more sense and are a lot faster to execute. Vimtuto is the pinacle of tutorials to get you started and overall has a much more modern and lightweight feel to it. It doesent for you into anything that you dont want to do, and thats why VIM RULES!!!!! EMACS SUCKS LETS GO TO WAR...HUZZZAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
